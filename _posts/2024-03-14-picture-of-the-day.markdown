It was quite chill in the early morning. It is the typical spring temperature gradient.  

I was able to swim the second 500m quite faster than the first one. 1:42/100m for the first round and 1:37/100m for the second.   

I am very happy with this progression. Let's see if in the future they will allow me again to do the turn on the wall. For the time being, I am banned from it. We are too many swimmers and I have been involved in argues too many times.   

I read a little bit of Feynman's book. Conservation of the energy. It is an extremely boring chapter.  

I was alone in the office. Does it make any sense at all to go there? The answer is yes. It makes sense for socializing but not for working. I quickly arranged a lunch with my friend Boris and we had a good time during the break.

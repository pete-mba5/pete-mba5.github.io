Yesterday evening I watched a sports YouTube. My takeaway is: "do not bet against the fat boy"   

I am tempted to update my unsupported Early 2024 MacBook Air. I do not know what will happen with this webpage since it is locally maintained in the MBA.   

Nasal breathing while running is part of my daily routine. Now I am trying to implement HIIT during the run. Yesterday I ran 8x1min sprints with 1min recovery. It felt good. Nasal breathing was challenging but I still can manage.

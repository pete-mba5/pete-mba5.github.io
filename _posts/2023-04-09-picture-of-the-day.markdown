Running with the GoPro in my hometown. This will be the new series for this week.  

It is just 1200km but the weather is milder here. I cannot listen to podcast while running because every detail and  every corner triggers old memories.  

Some places remain the same while others are totally changed. It is too late to document all the places I know since I  was born and raised in the same state, but I will try to do a good work, taking pictures of the most significant ones.  

Today I got a nice picture of the romanic building of St. Pere Ullastre, sorrounded by two of the peaks I am going to visit this week. To the right we can see "el Puig de la Creu" and to the left "La Mola".

The Sun is shining but the cold is very intense. I am planning to run at 2pm when the highest possible temperature will be reached. I am going to run with shorts again. The running tights experiment from yesterday resulted negative.  

The forecast is not better for the next two weeks, but it is winter so, what do we want?   

The bouldering reading is progressing very slowly. Yesterday while biking to the Brewery, I passed by The Rock. It was very crowded. I am still not sure, if this would be a good choice. I have to test it soon and stop theorizing.  

Manuel de Pedrolo's book "Mossegar-se la cua" is a good read. I am enjoying it a lot.  

I am sticking with the coursera daily tasks. I will finish the first course in a couple of weeks. I am starting to see some small results. I am confident this will help me in the future.

I finished Guilleries. I liked it. It was not about witchcraft.  

I repaired my Brompton. Now I have proper lights. I have to repair the rear fender, but first I need to purchase the spare parts.  

I finished the Blue Lotus and started the Broken Ear.

Somehow I managed to learn how to dowload a local copy of my recordings in the mba via python. Tomorrow I will try to back it up in my iPhone and sync with the watch. This is just in case I am running out of podcasts while running.

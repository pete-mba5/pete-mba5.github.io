Listened in a film: "Hell, you can even even get married here. Divorced, too. Then you can come back an drown your sorrows. Whole circle of life thing."   

It was very cold today. I brought my most important plants inside. We are going to reach below 0Â°C this week.   

I have read a couple more chaters of Harari. It is ok but I cannot progress too much. It bores me.   

I investigated about a MacOS, openBSD version of Keepass. Everything ready.

We arrived well. The car is a wrack. Noises, vibration, etc. I will bring it to the garage next Friday. Let's see what they can do. I am just driving it within the village in very short gears and very slow. This way, I am not feeling any vibration but some noise.   

I worked a little bit and will run in the afternoon. The weather is nice here. I met some old neighbors. It was nice.  

I will stretch a little bit and read for a while.  

In the evening we have dinner with one of my sisters. It will be late, unfortunately.

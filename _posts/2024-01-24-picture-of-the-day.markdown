I ran yesterday with the Virtual Partner feature on my smartwatch. It was a great motivation to run at a higher pace. The risk in a marathon is very clear. I can get out of gas for pushing too much and too early.  

I am reading "Les Calces al Sol". It is amazing me, but I least I can read something light in my own mothertonge.  

One arm push-ups can now be done on the floor. I am steadily improving. It is a slow but very consistent process.  

1. Getting closer to my parents although they are not physically around me.  
2. I created a convincing script for my Cyber-Security round.  
3. Soft skills.  
4. Complete last week of the Empathy online training.

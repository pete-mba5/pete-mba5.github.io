I went to the office by bike. It was sunny but the wind was frozen. I had to wear handgloves.  

My CI colleagues told me that someone has robbed their 1000â‚¬ coffee machine from the office. I wonder if this was a delayed April's fool joke.  

I still have to change the rear brake from my dad's bicycle. Because of this, I have re-routed my commute to the office without braking at all. I am now avoiding steep downhills and even braking. So far, everything is ok.

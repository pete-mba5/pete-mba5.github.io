Today I forced myself to do my stretching and yoga right after waking up. It was ok. Now I can spend some time sitting working without thinking about it anymore.  

I am starting to find the "Rational Optimist" a little bit too descriptive with the examples. I do not need that much to follow the argumentation. Let's see how all of this evolves.  

Yesterday in the late afternoon, I had to go outside and walk for almost one hour. I was getting some stomach ache. After the walk, I felt much better.  

The fire alarm is working perfectly. It would be great to know how to stop the alarm once you have the situation under control.

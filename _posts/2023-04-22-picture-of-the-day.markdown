I decided to read the fiction book "Bad Karma to the Power of Two". I have just read the first one and was funny.  

I have invested around three hours of my afternoon working on the garden. Now everything is properly setup. We can start the barbecue season.  

I have transferred two more apps to my new private iPhone. The end of the transition is getting closer and closer.

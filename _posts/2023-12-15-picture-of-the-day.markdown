I was able to reach 3:10 in one of the three sprints. If I remember well, this is my fastest speed recorded ever.

I was able to dismount the foot stand from the Samsung curved monitor. There is no other way than remove the whole plastic back. I cannot install it in Tim's room because it needs a specific power adaptor.

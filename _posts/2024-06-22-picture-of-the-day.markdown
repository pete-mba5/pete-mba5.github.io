It is a heavy rain day. I was funny to swim in the open air pool today. I have never experience before the impact of the rain drops on my arms and back while swimming. With my googles I could see perfectly in the water and blurry outside. It was really funny.  

I planned a couple of things in the early morning and I executed them without thinking. Now, at 1:30pm I am feeling that everything planned for the day is completed and I can start to relax. No more tasks will ask for my attention today.

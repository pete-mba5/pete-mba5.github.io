I did not pass the MOT. This is what happens when you purchase a nice car from a non reliable car manufacturer. Anyhow, I like my car so much that I am going to fix all the observations in a workshop and pass the MOT.   

Yesterday evening I started reading 'Boulder' from Eva Baltasar. I do not like it and I do not understand the story.  

I got 1000km on my Altra Escalante. It is time to say goodbye to them. I am not made to run with zero drop running shoes. The next ones to bring to the end are the Altra Viho.  

The weather is perfect for the barbecue.

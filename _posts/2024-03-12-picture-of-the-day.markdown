I spent the day at home waiting for a delivery from UPS. In the end, they did not show up but updated the tracking information with a message arguing that they could not deliver because I was not at home. Unbelievable.  

I am still reading Feynman's book. I listened to a Freakonomics podcast about Feynman too. I wonder what is going on with this guy now?  

I played my bass for one hour today.

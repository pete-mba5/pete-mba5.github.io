Listened in a Podcast: "I am a doctor, but I am not a real doctor". I had to laugh. The rest of the podcast was garbage as usual.   

I realized that podcast are mostly starting to have too many commercial interruptions. Maybe it is time to stop listening to them.   

Harari's book is starting to annoy me with to many Religious explanations that I really do not want.

It was a hard day back in the office. I had to fix urgent things and read 
infinite emails. Tomorrow everything will be under control.   

I read "Irresistible". Maybe tonight I'll finished it. I am feeling like there are very few new things being said in the latest part.   
  
My training today was very low quality. I am seeing the end of the daily running very soon.

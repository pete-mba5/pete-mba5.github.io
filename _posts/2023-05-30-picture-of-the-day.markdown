We went to "el Peixet" in Calafell. Last time I was there was in 2005. Everything looks the same, but it is not. The people running the business are different, I would say. The menu looks the same and tastes quite good.  

In the evening I ran to Creixell and was beautiful. I passed by the Augustu's Victory Arch in Roda de Bera.

Family is back.   

I will work 3 more hours today and will enjoy 1 week holidays.   

I made the portable router work and contracted the new Lebara plan.   

I read very few. I had not much time. I went to see my kids playing football.  

I baked pizzas twice. The second one, right after 12h was much better than the other one, around 8h. I listened that you have to leave the dough between 24 and 36h in a cool environment. Maybe someone I will test this.

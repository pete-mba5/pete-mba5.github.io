I slept very well althought the smartwatch says otherwise.  

Yesterday I purchased new trousers. My waist is getting thiner and thiner. Now I am W31 in jeans. I still remember when I was wearing W34 in the high school. 

I kept reading Asprey's book. Now it is getting non sense for me. I have no interest into jump in the supplement space. I am just reading it like someone would read the yellow pages, just to read something.  

We went to France yesterday. It just on the other side of the river. Surprisingly the burger we got in the restaurant was way better than the average one you can get here. I am not talking about Deliburgers, but the rest of the competitors.  

I got new Vomero 16 running shoes. I am going to try them right now.

I decided to prune my Rosmarinus and I did it. Now my lavanda have more space to grow.  

I want to read the Tintin books once again.  

I want to read and practice some quick yoga in the morning. My intention is to stretch more than meditate.  

I woke up in the morning without any alarm. I felt totally recovered although I only slept one and a half more than usual during the week.

It has beed the sunniest day of our short holidays. At 5pm the Spanish hords arrived. Only yesterday there were 100 new entries. We won't be able to enjoy the pool and the rest of the recreational equipment as we used to.  

I ran barefoot again. My ankles are ok, but since the shore is deeply inclined, my left knee is aching a little bit.  

I got really tanned. My skin is not burnt though.

While having lunch, some pieces of squid fell on the floor. Mama Bird was faster than the waiters and she took the pieces and fed her offsprings. Brauli took some pictures to record the moment. He did a good job.

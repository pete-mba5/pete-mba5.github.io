Today is a bank holiday here. I will spend the day with my kids. The Sun will shine, let's see what we will do.  

Today is the first day of the pool summer season. I need a season card. The best offer is the family one. It consists of free entrance to 4 different open air pools for 4 months, for 4 family members and just 300EUR. If only one member of the family is going for a swim for two months daily, the cost is already covered. It is perfect for me.  

I am a little bit upset that my tiny macbook air's battery is not lasting a lot. Anyhow, I do not need it too many hours a day. It seems to be a superfluous need. I will observe it. Maybe it will dissipate soon.

I went to the office. Basically to print my tickets for the UX event next week in Stuttgart.  

We had an event with the big boss. It was funny. We played percussions instruments and learnt a couple of things that could easily map to our business life. I met phisically people I have been remotely working with since the pandemic. It was all in all a good event. I am happy that I decided to go.  

Right after the event I rode my bike to the pool. It was crowded. Definitely, it is summertime. Anyhow, I was lucky enough to find an almost empty lane besides the pros training. After the swimming I realized that this has been my fastest 50m training so far. Good job.   


In the evening I tried to read Celsius from Marc Elsberg. It is in German and after the first chapter I felt asleep.

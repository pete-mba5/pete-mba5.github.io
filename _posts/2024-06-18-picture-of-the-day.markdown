With my run today I will complete 3 years of daily run. This will be the end of the streak. I am starting to have unbearable pain in my joins. Specially both ankles.  

It is raining again. What a summer. Let's see what happen in August.   

I read Scott Adams' book last evening. I did not like it so much and jumped to Balaji's one. It was ok for 20mins, but I finally got bored and switched for Max Bennet's "Brief History of Intelligence". I kept reading it until my eyes closed themselves.   

Yesterday evening, while walking around the neighborhood, I saw white geraniums. They are really beautiful. I will look for some in the internet.

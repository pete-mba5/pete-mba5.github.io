I succeeded baking a toast bread myself. Great achievement.  

I read Tintin in Tibet. It was not great in my opinion.  

I returned the broken USB-C lightning adaptor. 

I prepared green curry for the next three days.  

I prepared two different desserts for the next three days.  

I started stretching. I will maintain until the end of the year. It is just 30mins and I am planning to have one session in the early morning and another one in the evening.

I finally finished "The Future" by Naomi Alderman. I did not like it. The only exception is the part where, Marius, the Romanian teacher lecturing his students. Just after shutting off the reader, I was thinking about registering and giving a review in Goodreads. I woke up in the early morning and went to the webpage. I read some reviews. I felt bad. I researched who was owning Goodreads, Amazon. Google gave me an article from the Washington Post critizising Goodreads evolution after Amazon's acquisition. I read some comments too. I decided to do not register or comment on Goodreads. I wil do it just here, this book is garbage, does not worth my time. Never again, Naomi.  

Now I am going to swim a little bit in Grötzingen and later, I will run the second part of my yesterday's marathon track.  

While I am writing this, I am listening to a podcast about Cobla filarmònica playing jazz songs. It is so beautiful that I will make it a favorite and will listen quite often.  

The swimming went pretty ok. I was able to swim at 1:37-1:38. I was lucky today, just a couple of good swimmers in our dedicated lane.  

The running was also ok. I was able to run 94% of the time in zone 2 and just 10s in zone 3.  

I did my TWYOB strengh training and stretching. I took good care of my fitness today.  

I changed my mind for lunch and did not prepare the aspargarous. I cooked yakisoba with vegetables instead. It was simply yummy.   

I restarted a new book from Pedrolo "Cendra per Martina".

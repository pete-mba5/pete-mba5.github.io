I finally finished "The Future" by Naomi Alderman. I did not like it. The only phase I was into it, was this where the Romanian teacher was in it. Just after shutting off the reader, I was thinking about registering and giving a review in Goodreads. I woke up in the eraly morning and went to the webpage. I read some reviews. I felt bad. I researched who was owning Goodreads, Amazon. Google gave me an article from the Washington Post critizising Goodreads evolution after Amazon's acquisition. I read some comments too. I decided to do not register, comment on Goodreads. Just here, this book is garbage, does not worth my time. Never again.  

I am going now to swim a little bit in Grötzingen and later, run the second part of my yesterday's marathon track.  

While I am writing this, I am listening to a podcast of Cobla filarmònica playing jazz songs. It is so beautiful that I will make it a favorite and will listen quite often.

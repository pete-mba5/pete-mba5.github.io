I found a bash script to generate the persistent google photos URL for this blogpost.  

I am still unable to combine this script with my entries template one. I cannot subsitute with sed URL. I am running it on a MacOS and after researching the web, it looks like I have to tweak a little bit. I will try again whenever I have some spare time.  

I was re-reading the chapter about continuous glucose monitor of Peter Attia's latest book "Outlive".  

I am still soared on my legs. I do not get it completely. I can run a marathon in 3:27 and next day I do not have any pain, but I do some legs strength exercises with my own body and two days later I still heavily soared. I am getting older.

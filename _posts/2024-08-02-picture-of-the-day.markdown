I am back to normal. I slept like a baby.   

"Slow Productivity" is starting to be a tedious read. I will finish as soon as possible.   

The weather changed again and now it is cloudy and mild. Let's see if the pool is empty again.   

I received my blue swimming googles in less than 24h. For me this is the fastest Amazon delivery I have ever had. I will test them today. In my opinion it wasn't the brown googles but the quality of the water, but let's see today if I see better with the blue ones.   

Lebara is offering new interesting products. I will evaluate them and decide after the holidays.

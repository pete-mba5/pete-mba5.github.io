Today is my day, St. Peter and Paul. It is terribly hot. I did few things.  

I am reading the brief history of Intelligence. I like it.   

I skipped swimming today. I assumed that with this heat, the pool would be booked out. I do not want to fight. Let's see tomorrow morning how I am feeling.  

Tonight Germany is playing agains Denmark in football. Beers are in the fridge.

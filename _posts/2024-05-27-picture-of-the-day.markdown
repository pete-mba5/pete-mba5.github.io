It was a quiet day.  

We enjoyed the beach and the pool.  

For lunch we had grill pork feet. They were delicious.  

In the late afternoon, I went to do some errands. I really hope that they will be the last.   

I started reading Scott Adams' book about goal setting. It was kind of fun, but I am not totally sure that I will like it.

It is a beautiful sunny and cool day.   

I read almost half of the book about stoicism. I like it.   

I am trying to remember a sequence of inputs: I have to go to the toilett, complaint about parking too far away, complaint about walking inside the building and not being able to breath, complaint about the luggage lady, complaint about the public transportation, complaint about the cost of the extra ride, complaint about temperature, complaint about a noise, questioning the root cause of the noise, mixing up comfort with safetty issues, questioning the idea of driving my car to my hometown, asking about last week weather, questoning my answer although I have been here all the time, asking for post, asking for post addressed to her. This happened during a 1,5h trip. I need to think about this deeper.

It rained a lot.  

I went to Swim. I took the cross bike. It has no fenders. I went through the forest. It was a big error because it started to rain heavily on my way back. I arrived home totally soaked and covered with mud.  

I  managed to run and stretch but by the end of the day, I had no more energy for do anything else. I went sooner to bed.

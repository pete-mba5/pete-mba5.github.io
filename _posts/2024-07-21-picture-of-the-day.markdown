I finished Scott Adams' book. I liked how he summarized the most important points in the last chapter. Funny, you do not need to read the book at all. Anyhow, it was a light and entertaining read.   

I sletp like a human being again. 80%.  

Yesterday we went to the Rheinstrandbad and was totally crowded. It was ok and according to the plan. Yesterday was the hottest day of the 2024.   

I finished creating my new private accounts for tracking my trainings. I am out of sports social media.   

We went to the pool and found some kids from school. Tim played with them for hours. It was like he was with them last week. I liked it a lot seeing them playing. I also used this time to stretch.  

I lost two connection trains because of unexpected delays.

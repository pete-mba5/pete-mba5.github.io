I finished Scott Adams' book. I liked how he summarized the most important points in the last chapter. Funny, you do not need to read the book at all. Anyhow, it was a light and entertaining read.   

I sletp like a human being again. 80%.  

Yesterday we went to the Rheinstrandbad and was totally crowded. It was ok and according to the plan. Yesterday was the hottest day of the 2024.   

I finished creating my new private accounts for tracking my trainings. I am out of sports social media.

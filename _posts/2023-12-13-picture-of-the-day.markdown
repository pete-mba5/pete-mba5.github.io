I accidentally hit again a swimmer and got another unnecessary discussion.   

It is really interesting how all of them start the argue: I know you swim very fast, but...   

I wonder what are all these people doing in a lane reserved for fast swimmers, but since this is a totally free pool, I swallow my comments and just apologize.

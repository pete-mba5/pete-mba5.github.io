Today is sunny and mild. Perfect day for a run in the forest. 

Yesterday evening I investing a couple of hours researching for smartwatches with NFC payment. I already have one and never used this feature. I am still wondering why.  

Guilleries is being read consistently. I really do not know what is going on, but I have the hunch that maybe it will be about witchcraft or similar.  

Tintin and the Blue Lotus is great. I like it a lot. For the time being, it is my favourite.

I finished the book "The Distraction Addiction". It was a quick read with some interesting ideas, that I had already read somewhere else.  

I am trying some of these ideas and for the time being, it is going well. I am just checking my corporate email 2 to 3 times a day. The rest of the day, the Outlook remains closed. My appointments can be checked on TEAMS.  

Once I am consistent with the abandonment of the email, I will remove the Outlook app from the iPhone. I am currently not using it, but I still want to keep it just in case.  

The Sabbath initiative and the mindful use of the technology will come a little bit later.

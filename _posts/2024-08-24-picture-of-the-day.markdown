I sleep like a baby again. I am feeling fully recovered. I am soared from yesterday's training. It is mainly the chest and a little bit my back. My legs need some stretching too.   

Today it is going to be very hot. People came to the pool very early. I was able to swim very well.  

I am planning to do some chores at home today. One of the bathrooms today and the other one tomorrow. I will paint the door. I will prepare a dessert and fresh cheese. I will bike my new bike for 30mins and will capture the picture of the day during this round.   

Yesterday evening I finished the book about wealth and stoics. I liked it. I would not recommend this read to anyone. Since I am 50 now, maybe it is a bit too late for implementing any of the recommendations, but I learnt something about the pension system I had overlooked. I need to investigate deeper and act. This is a priority A.   

Today I am planning to read a little bit of fiction.   

I rode my new/old road bike. It is fast. I like it a lot.

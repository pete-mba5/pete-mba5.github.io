Today I started the Mile challenge with Dani.   

I worked out a little bin in the garden. One of the bushes is now looking better.   

I just realized that my i-clip wallet is broken.   

I finished "totes les bèsties de càrrega" from Pedrolo and I liked it a lot.  

Now I am continuing with "The Rational Optimist"   

Tomorrow is the Neckarufer Marathon.  

Yesterday in the evening, I ran some 5G speed tests and the better network at home is O2. This wil presumibly influence which SIM card I will hold when not having my corporate phone.

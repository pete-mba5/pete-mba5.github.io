Today is my sister's birthday.  

The weather is sunny again. I will work a little bit less than usual. Lots of my German colleagues are enjoying a bridge day and won't work today.   

The book about the brain is interesting and a good read. Tonight I will go back to Pedrolo's novel though.   

I briefly checked the options to fly for Pentecost holidays and it is too late to find interesting offers. I will probably need to adjust my schedule.

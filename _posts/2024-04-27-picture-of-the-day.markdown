I am feeling good. Totally recovered. I will stretch and run a long one.  

It resulted in my longest run ever, 26.8miles. I am tired now. I could run at this pace a little bit longer. Maybe it was the heat, or something I do not know, but today it was very challenging to keep the heartrate in the zone 2/3. I am happy with the result.

If everything works as expected, today it is going to be warm again and partially sunny. I will run just with a t-shirt and as soon as possible.  

Naomi's book is getting more interesting. I am around 80% of it. I will finish it today.

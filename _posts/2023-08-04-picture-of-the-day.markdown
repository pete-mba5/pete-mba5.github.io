Very productive day. I am enjoying a lot reading again the Adventures of Tintin. 

I spent the afternoon in the kitchen batch cooking desserts for the whole week. My target is to empty the fridge and clean it up. I will be able to do it by Wednesday next week.  

One task per day is still being done.

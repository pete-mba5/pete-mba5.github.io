I finished the Sceptre of Ottokar and started the Crab with the Golden Claws.  
I finished reading Randonautica. I liked the idea behind but not the book.  

I felt exhausted yesterday. It is getting hot again and I do not like it.  

The lactate test replicated the KIT results and this means that we have an amateur alternative to the professional one.

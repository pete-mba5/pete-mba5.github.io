It was a huge surprise when I went to lunch and found my sister waiting for us with my wife...   

We had lunch together and a couple of Corpinnats later. It was very funny. Tanja introduced her to Oktoberfest hits. They had a great evening together.   

I went to pick up something from McDonnalds with my kids and later played football in the dark. We also had our adventures when Brauli kicked the ball outside the camping. We looked for the ball with torches. In the end it landed behind the fence of the railway. We were very lucky that during night there are almost no trains and that in this precise place the fence is easy to trespass...   

I read a little bit more of the "Irresistible" book.

It has been a day on the road. I went to the airport to pick up my sister and her friends and brought them to my hometown. I packed some more things from my parents. I came back to the camping. Since it was Sunday, they made one of the lanes reverse. All went well but took some time.   

We played basketball, waterpolo in the pool for almost one hour and finally went to the beach. I swam to the green buoy and back. The Sun was too low and I was unable on my way back to see properly. I lost the line and ended up swimming back the same way. I will try again another day.   

I read a little bit of Adam Alter's "Irresistible". It is a very addictive read. I like the subject and how he writes about it.

I tried to trim the hedge today. I got interrupted by an electrical storm just in the middle. I will continue another day.  

My plan to cover myself completely with Autan worked perfectly. No bites suffered today.  

I ran and wam in the early morning before going to the office. It turned to be a good idea. There were less people in the pool.   

I will invest the rest of my time into organizing a couple of boxes in the basement.   

In the late evening I will continue reading "a brief history of Intelligence" by Max Bennett.	

I found another dead bird in my backyard. This is the second this week.

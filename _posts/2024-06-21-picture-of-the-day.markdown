Yesterday I forgot my company card and discovered a funny thing. There is no way you can print private documents without the card.  

The rubber from my swimming googles got broken yesterday. I was observing it and also looking for spare parts in the internet. Luckily I have a tiny head and could easily fix it with the rest of the band.   

I need to go to the office again. Today it is a rainy day and finding the right time window for the commute will be challenging. Target is not end totally soaked.   

There are that much mosquitos that makes no fun being outside. In the pool it is really annoying.

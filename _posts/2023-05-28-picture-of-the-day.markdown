I am worried about a noise in the car. It could be a wheel bearing one. I am going to bring the car to a garage to get it investigated and eventually fixed here.  

We got visited by Eva, Edgar and Guillem. It was a very short one, but it was nice to see them again. Yesterday they had to go a little bit earlier home because they wanted to vote in the local election.  

I got hit by the bungalow's door. My heel has no more skin and bled for a very long time. Because of this, I arrived late to the restaurant and when we ordered, the kitchen was already closed. Lesson Learnt.

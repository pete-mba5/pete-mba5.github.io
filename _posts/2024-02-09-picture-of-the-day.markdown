I totally forgot that my kids will have holidays next week.  

Yesterday night I started a new Pedrolo book. I need fiction to read. Somehow I am getting bored with non fiction only.  

I purchased enough rain clothes for my biking. I have to check how to put everything back in the bag for easy transport.

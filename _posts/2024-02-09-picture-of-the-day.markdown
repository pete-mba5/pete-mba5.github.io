I totally forgot that my kids will have holidays next week.  

Yesterday night I started a new Pedrolo book. I need fiction to read. Somehow I am getting bored with non fiction only.  

I purchased enough rain clothes for my biking. I have to check how to put everything back in the bag for easy transport.   

Since I am running without my headsets, I can listen to lots of things. One of my new hobbies is to listen to the words that some people walking their dogs are saying while I am crossing them. The winner today was "Scheisse"

Random run brought me today to Ettlingenweier. I woke up early and went to run just after a coffee. Considering how hot it was today, I can affirm that this was the right decision.  

Yesterday I finished Seth Godin's free book about education. Well, not much to say about it, but I agree that we should escape from the battle for the bottom, this brings nothing.  

We went to the Rheinstrandbad again and it was quite packed. Anyhow, we found the place and time for our activities. It was a great day.

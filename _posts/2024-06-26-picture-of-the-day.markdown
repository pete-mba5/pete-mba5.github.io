All day trapped in a virtual workshop with people from France and Morocco. Somehow I managed to run and swim too.   

In the late afternoon I gardened a little bit. It was just the landlord agreed with me that next Tuesday he will be at home discussing about the rear fence bush. Let's see if he brings more surprises.   

I read Balaji's book in the evening.

Yesterday and today I have invested most of my working time into the Cybersecurity and I like it a lot. All the time paid off. My meetings turned to be ok.   

I went to the pool today and was totally booked out. It was very challenging to swim because of the high ocupation of the lane. It resulted again in my fastest 1000m in a 50m pool. Maybe the fact that I have to overtake that many people all the time forces me to swim faster to avoid crashes.   

Today is the hottest day of the year, as far as I can remember.   

Yesterday evening I retook "the Rational Optimist". I like the subject and how fast you can read the argumentation.   

This is a very weird week. I will be in the office almost every single day. Shame on me.

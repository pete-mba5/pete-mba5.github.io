The anecdote of the day can be summarized with "Bad Behavior".  

The story is too surreal and long to be written here. If you meet me sometime, just ask me and will explain it to you.  

I finished reading "Joc Brut" de Manuel de Pedrolo. It has been an extraordinary surprise. It is probably my favorite of 2023, although the novel is from 1965.

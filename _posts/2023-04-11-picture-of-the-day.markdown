I visited today Sant Esteve de Castellar Vell and again I got lost in the forest. St. Stephan is the patron of my village and this is the old church, very close to our river, el Ripoll.  

There are too many unmarked new paths created by the mountainbikers.  

The weather is like in Summer here. I do not need the jacket anymore to run. The Sun is not killing yet, but it is better to run on the shadows. The wind is still cold. They are almost perfect conditions to run.

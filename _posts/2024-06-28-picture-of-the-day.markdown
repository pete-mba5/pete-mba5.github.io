Big surprise of the day. It looks like the dwarf banana plant was not dead but sleeping.   

The summer finally arrived and the heat is here. It is hard to have a good sleep and rest.   

I finished Balaji's book. You do not need a full book for this.   

It has been a long day in the home office. Since I hade two events this week, Friday resulted in a catch up day. I am happy to be done for the day.

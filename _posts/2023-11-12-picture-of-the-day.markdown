I ran to Epplesee and swam 800m at 6Â°C. I returned home running too.  

I am pretty impressed about this. It was not hard completing it, but swimming in the lake is totally different than in the pool. I cannot swim straight and have to stop a lot. After 100m, I decided to change styles. 20 strokes crawl, plus 10 strokes backwards and finally 10 more strokes breast loop. This way I was able to steadily swim until the other shore.  

Once out of the water, I had to change my clothes fast and get as dry as possible. The first two kilometers of the second running leg was a little bit difficult. I was lucky that I picked up the gloves. After 2km, everything felt as normal as usual.  

I have already purchased a new swim trunk. I need to train breast a little bit more and with my current set, it is impossible.

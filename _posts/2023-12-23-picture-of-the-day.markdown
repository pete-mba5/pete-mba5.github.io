Something attacked me on the right leg. Some insect, I mean. It is itching now. Maybe a spider.   

I need to do some errants today. Next three days everything will be closed because of Christmas. People are worried, they do not want to starve. There is no reason to have such a thought.    

I kept reading Murakami and the miracle morning. The second one will be forgotten very soon after finishing it. It is very repetitive and boring.  

It rains a lot. The whole day. The paths in the forest are muddy and it is very difficult to sprint. Last time I sprinted, I thought about an old dog I had. When he sprinted, he twisted his body. Somehow, I thought that me is also running like this and that's the reason why I am not able to run faster.  

The stretching practice is working phenomenally. I can see how the movement range is increasing steadily and I feel no pains at all. Only the right shoulder needs a little bit more patience. It lacks rotation.  

These days, I will try a couple of experiments in the kitchen. I will report the results.

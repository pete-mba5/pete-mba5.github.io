I finished Omid's book about Blockchain. I liked it a lot.  

It is really windy today. Let's see how the commute to the office will go.  

There is something in the Rust course that does not work. I can run the scripts in the terminal, but everything related to VSC don't. I do not find the discussion board very useful at all and so far do not know how to contact the teacher.  

Yesterday I managed to organize the password chaos I have for Xbox and Nintendo. One thing less to do.

Getting ready to hit the highway.  

The hit of the day was not the running or the drive back home but Tim's Pokemon God's pack.  

Yes he did it. According to his information it has a 1/10.000.000.000 probability and he has got it.  

It was really a crazy moment in the car with both kids shouting "OMG we got a God's pack" after checking that every card was more precious than the previous one.

I ran yesterday a marathon in Stuttgart. It was 100% asphalt. I am a little bt soared today.  

The weather changed a lot again. I will bring some of my tropical plants indoors. The wind has broken one of the stems of my Sterilizia.   

I am reading a book from Carlo Rovelli about laws of Physics. I am liking it a lot.   

I will just go to the office on Thursday.

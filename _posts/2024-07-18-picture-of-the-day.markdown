I went to the office by bike. I had to slow down a lot. It is very hot.  

The pool is getting crowded in the early morning too. I will go tomorrow at 9am. Maybe then it is easier to swim.   

My dwarf banana is growing a lot. I will keep it in the pot. This way, I will have some green in the building during winter.  

I made all the purchases for the pizza night next Tuesday.   

I emptied all the trash bins. I wonder if I should do it every evening instead of once a week.

The plan for today is to mow the lawn. It rained during the night thus maybe I won't be able to fulfill it.  

I am just a 30% ahead of finishing the biohacking book. I am seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.  

The stretching session went very well. I am feeling better in the psoas area. I will run a short one with sugar cane protocol today.

I am reading about the yoga transitions in my routine.  

The "Rational Optimist" from yesterday was very optimistic, in my opinion. I am liking the read a lot. I will stay here instead of "Les calces al Sol".  

DB strike is killing me.  

On my way back home, I had the chance to spot this pixel art. I took the picture and immediately noticed something weird. I analyzed the art and effectively, there is an error in the matrix.

I started reading a book from Michael Gates Gill, called How Starbucks saved my Life.
I am liking it. It is a very fast and easy reading. It looks like something autobyographical, but I am not sure.  

I have prepared my Balcon Plants 2023. They wil be in the garden for a couple of days and then I will bring them to their final location.

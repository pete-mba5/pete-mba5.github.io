It is a bak holiday in Germany. Almost everyone in the camping is from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.  

We went a little bit earlier to the restaurant and luckily, we got our lunch as expected. Today the black rice was better than the first day. Next time I won't order the Rice menu, since it includes too many starters, I really do not need.  

I am reading a book from David Deutsch. It is interesting but not an light read. I need to be focussed in order to get a lot from it, but I like the subject.

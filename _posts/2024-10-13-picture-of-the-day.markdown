I went to run 12k today. Only nasal breathing. It went very well.   

"Because you succeded selling computers in the 90s, does not mean that you are able to eliminate world hunger" I had to laugh when I lestened to it. It is so true.   

I am currently reading last book from Harari "Nexus". Like all his books, I like reading them. If I fully believe what he says is a different story.   

I listened to a podcast about music to be played very loud in the car. I discovered a band called Boston. I remembered how I liked Rage against the machine and LCD soundsystem. Speaking about music, yesterday I listened to a podcast about a Detroid garage band called Dirtbombs. In the 2011 they released an album called "Party Store" it is about versioning Detroit Techno songs. I liked it so much that I have to get the album.

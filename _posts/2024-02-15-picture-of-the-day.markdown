Word of the day "also".   

Today it was very hot. First day of 2024 running just with a t-shirt.   

Yesterday I started reading a new book by Manuel de Predolo "Totes les bèsties de càrrega". As usual, I like it.   

I have been working in the basement the last three days and I like it.   

I have again some pain on my right heel. Everything happened after running with the Altra zero drop after a very long time not using them at all. Maybe it is time to scrap them and stop the natural running. It looks like it is not for me.   

Yesterday I finally completed my script in bash for this personal homepage. I happy with it. Just execute the script and go into the entry template to write down some random thoughts.

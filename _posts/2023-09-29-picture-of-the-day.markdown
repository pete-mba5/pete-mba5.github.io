I finished the book "the Thing in the Snow". Somehow I felt like belonging to this group.  

We have a full Moon and no clouds. The picture with the iPhone is not good, but it was the best I could afford.  

I am keeping with Yoga, stretching and running without headsets/music. My shoulder muscles are starting to gain flexibility. My calfs are improving and my heel pain disappearing.

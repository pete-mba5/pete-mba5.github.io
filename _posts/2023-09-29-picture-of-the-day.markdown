I finished the book "the Thing in the Snow" by Sean Adams. Somehow I felt like belonging to this group.  

We have a full Moon and no clouds. The picture with the iPhone is not good, but it was the best I could afford.  

I am keeping up with Yoga, stretching and running without headsets/music.  

My shoulder muscles are starting to gain flexibility. My calfs are elonging and my heel pain is almost completely gone.

Yesterday we went to the Badisches Staatstheater to enjoy a ballet show. It was great. None of my kids complained too much. It was a little bit too long for them though. After the break, I was able to recognise every single piece. All of them have been used for commercial purposes. Even one was used as intro in a podcast I s
used to follow.   

Today the Sun is shining again. It is time to run outside the forest. Since it is also dry, I will run with the Asics shoes.   

I tried to read a little bit more, but Murakami's is getting very boring. Just after 5mins, I fell asleep.  

The smartwatch is not charging again. Is it the cable? Is it the unit? Nobody knows. Maybe it is a sign that I have to start to forget it and come back to the unique Suunto Core. No smart, but 100% watch.

1 I am not getting injured.
2 We cooked together self-made tacos in the pizza oven and they rocked
3 Improve my soft skills
4 Finish the empathy Coursera course. I will fulfil one lesson a day.

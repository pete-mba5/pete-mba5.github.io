I like more and more the flybys feature from strava. Unfortunately I am unable to match yet all the people I cross while running.   

My next target is to balance wear of my active running shoes. This week I will bring my Adidas Lego to 500k and then, the rest of the Ultraboost and Puma.  

I am reading now the chapter about the survivalist. I do not like it like I liked the one about Martha.  

Today it is not raining. Maybe I will mow the lawn and spread the new grass seeds in the rest of the garden. Tomorrow it should rain again.

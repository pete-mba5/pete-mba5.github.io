Yesterday I went to the Oktoberfest in Karlsruhe. I can say, that I survived it.   

After bringing my sister to the airport, I went to the pool to swim. It went pretty ok, considering the circumstances.   

I am reading the Seneca letters.  

Yesterday I managed to install the bike rack in my new/old Cannondale R800. It was not easy or fast, but I am pretty happy with the results. I will be able to commute to the office with it very soon.

The Rose was totally covered with Flying Ants. In my childhood, we thought that this was a sign of an upcoing tempest. Maybe a coincidence but later in the evening, I was caught by a tempest while running.  

Although I am checking the picture carefully, I can barely identify any Flying Ant. This is really weird...

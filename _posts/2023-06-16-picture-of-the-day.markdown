I went to watch “The Flash” with the kids. It was an entertaining film. We liked it.
I am struggling finding the right spot in the backyard for my potted plants. Some of them are getting burnt, others do not get enough Sun and are not growing. I will probably need a couple more weeks of try and error. What is pretty clear is that the advice of watering some cactus every 3 weeks, does not fit for me.

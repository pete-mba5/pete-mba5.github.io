I am feeling weird. Some stomach ache or similar.   

"Visita a la Sra Soler" is being a nice, addicitve read so far.  

I got a recommendation from a podcast: "Nostalgia" from Barbara Cassin. Let's see.   

Word of the day "andere"   

mein Real was finally converted to a REWE. I detected some of the old employees with new branded clothes.

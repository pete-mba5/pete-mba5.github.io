I ran for the last time my Altra Viho. I surpassed the thousand km. My conclussion is, never again.  

I am reading Naomi Alderman's book "The Future". It is entertaining so far.  

This is a shitty week. It is raining a lot and now the wind is getting stronger. In the morning I saw lots of broken tree branches on the floor.  

I finalized the migration of Stadtmobil to my new handset.

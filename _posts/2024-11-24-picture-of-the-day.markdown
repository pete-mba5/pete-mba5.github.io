Today we had summer again. Unbelievable. While running in the forest I saw one guy swimming in the the lake. It is forbidden though.   

I worked in the garden for a while. Maybe I have finally killed my lavender. Let's see in spring.   

I will finish Harari's book today. Yesterday I read a very strange piece about the blockchain. The author seems to fear that governments owning 51% of it, will be able to remove the histor tracking. I cannot get it, since the blockchain is decentralized and one of the USP is the track of every single operation. Anyhow, I will sleep well tonight.

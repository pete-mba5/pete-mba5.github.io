Yesterday I managed to order my very first domain. I also order my own server. I will learn about independence technology with Derek Sivers.   

At 4:07am I could not sleep any more. My stomach is aching a lot.   

Harari's book is getting more interesting, but anyhow, the author is very repetitive with his narrative.

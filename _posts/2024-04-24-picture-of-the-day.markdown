I finished mowing the lawn yesterday. Today will rain. Perfect timing.  

I have to go to the office. I will probably use the poncho again. I will try not to sweat a lot.  

No calls or news from the workshop, this is good.  

I was able to read three chapters of "The Future". It was not extremely amazing, but I could not sleep.  

I skipped stretching and yoga yesterday. I felt a new foot pain on my right one. It happens when I walk upstairs and land my foot flat instead of on the front.  

Today I finally will got to swim again. It has been impossible the last two iterations.

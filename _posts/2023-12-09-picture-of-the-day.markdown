I finally organized the kitchen. It took me three hours. I made the meat croquettes, I put in containers the broth, I pureed the veggies, I cleaned the meat from skin and bones, I cut it small and finally prepared another bechamel. I cleand everything started a washing machine and made a tiramisu.  

I read a little bit more of Outlive from Peter Attia. I losing my interest in it. Maybe I was looking for a plan and I am getting a lot of justifications that I really do not need.  

I matched a 11km un in my zone 2. The next challenge would be doing it without checking my watch every two minutes.  

In the evening I watched the first episode of "The IT crowd". This show was recommended during the last "Security Manager" training. Since I was in front of the beamer, I watch a couple of season 1, episode 1: Stranger Things and Black Mirror. The latest one, looked like a modern "the Twilight Zone" serie I watched when I was a kid. I liked it a lot.

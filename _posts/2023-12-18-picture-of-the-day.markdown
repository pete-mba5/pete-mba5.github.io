I finished "Homenatge als caiguts" d'Albert Sanchez Pinol. It is very positive book with very short stories. I liked it a lot.   

I am confident that this year I will reach the mark of 1 book read per week. However, I am afraid that next year I will only consider fiction books for this challenge. Somehow non-fiction books do not make me that happy.

I have finally figured out how to measure my HRV with the FR945 and the chest strap. I will try to measure this value first thing in the morning.

The weather continues sunny and cold. Perfect conditions for running.

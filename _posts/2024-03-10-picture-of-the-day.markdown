I did my second test of the mile challenge. It went pretty well. I can run steadily at 3:50 without any problem. Next step is pacing at 3:44.  

I continue reading Richard Feynman's book.  

I went to the pool in the morning with my youngest son. It was not very crowded and I could swim my 1000m without many problems or interruptions. Let's see tomorrow.   

I wonder why people using strava disconnected the flybys.

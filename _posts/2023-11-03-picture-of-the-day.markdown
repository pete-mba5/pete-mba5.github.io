80m high is a little bit too much for me, but apparently not for my oldest son. He enjoyed it a lot. 

I am learning the bass line of "Here comes your man" from the Pixies. I have invested a couple of hours and I would say that I can play it.  

I continued reading "once upon a prime". In part because it was not that bad and also because I forgot to purchae the Booker Prize 2023 short list ones.

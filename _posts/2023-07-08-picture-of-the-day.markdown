This is the hottest week of the year.  

I went to the Rheinstrand pool with Tim. Last wave bath is at 17:30. We were late.  

It was crowded, but the place is so huge, that it does not matter. We found our spot and had fun.  

Right after we picked up Brauli and went to the cinema. Last Idiana Jones' film. I really do not know what to think about it. Probably I won't watch it again.

Routine finished.   

I am reading "Les calces al Sol". Nothing remarkable so far. Let's see if I will finish it.   

This is the last week of my Empathy training. It is getting more and more challenging to absorb new approaches. Maybe I am not the one for this skill.  

Because of the cold, I have put some pots inside my place. They got confused with the warmth and started blooming.

The Planzenklauer struck back and it was very nice.   

Today is Tim's birthday.   

The neighbor is using all his free time in making noises in the house. Probably he is trying to install a new heating system and needs to crash the old installation. It is going to be a interesting phase.   

Sony Nex 6 batteries are loaded and ready to work. Unfortunately the light today is very scarce. Let's see what I find.   

I got disappointed that the coursera empathy course cannot be fully followed through the iPad. They require for some modules to use a computer. I am curious about the reason why. I will check later.  

I am getting very convinced that the ASICS Kayano will be the shoes to run the marathon. They are extremely comfortable.

The DB strike impacted heavily my day. I read a lot yesterday. Since "les calces al Sol" is getting very boring, I started "the rational optimist". It is interesting, although I do not share everything he says.   

I was able to fulfill all my fitness routines.  

Sleep's quality is getting consistently over 80%. The only change is just stop eating 3h before sleeping and stop drinking 2h before it.  

The Rust online course is very interesting and funny. I am confident that I will finish it.

It was a very windy night. I lost some of the plastic pottery I had in the backyard.  

I returned the xBox to Amazon. They were great accepting the return after 15days the return windows was closed.  

I brought all the pots to the balconies. It is looking even better.  

I finished Tintin and the cigars of the Pharaoh. I started reading Guilleries from Ferran Garcia.

I started reading again Murakami's running book. I am amazed that I could not remember a single piece of it. I like it.  

Today is my first day of the Christmas holidays. It felt phantastic to sleep until I couldn't sleep anymore and wake up totally recovered.  

I am going to do the same I did during the summer holidays. I will fulfill one task a day. That's it. Once I am done with it. I will spend the day relaxed, reading, walking, etc.  

Today I am going to visit the Anime Store. Let's see if I find something interesting for my kids.

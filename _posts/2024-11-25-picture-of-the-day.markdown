It is dark. It is not cold. It is a weird winter. I will go to the office with the bike. Maybe I will go to swim in the afternoon.   

During the weekend I had no time to re-install the MacOS in my new SSD.   

My new personal domain was approved and ready. I can continue with the installation of the server. I really do not remember where I left it, thus maybe I will need to start from scratch.  

I finished Harari's book. I cannot recommend it at all. After checking my own thoughts, I overall found it very boring. Now I will continue reading "re-architecting trust" from Omid Malekan. It is about crypto. It is from 2022 and maybe too old for this subject.

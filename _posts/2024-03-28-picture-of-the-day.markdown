It was a great day of ski in Kitzb√ºhel. I snowed a lot in the afternoon. Kids had fun and me too.  

I ran along the river while snowing. It was really cold. My shoes are now over the heating. Let's see how they will be tomorrow morning.   

I kept reading Mr. Asprey's book. I am checking constantly how many minutes I will need to complete it. What a non-sense book.   

4 hours after finishing ski, I am still having very sensitive fingertips.

Great day working from home. It was like sommer again.   

I closed one my oldest paypal accounts. I did not remember I still had it. I got roughly 30euros. Not bad. This week I also receoverd some old crypto wallet and contained less than this amount.   

It is highly probable that tonight we are going to watch Deadpool and Wolverine at the theater.

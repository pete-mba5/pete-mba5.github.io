It was another summer day while finishing October. Unbelievable.  

We went to see in the lake again. 16Â°C water temperature. I felt great.   

I purchased all the needed parts and tools for refilling the gearbox oil of my Alfa.   

I purchased Tim's handball size 0.   

Listened in a podcast "I am pretty smart". I did not stopped it. I am amazed of myself. I was thinking about it the whole day.

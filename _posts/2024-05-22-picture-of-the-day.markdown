Yesterday evening we celebrated my sister's birthday. It was late, but did it anyhow.   

I slept pretty bad. If I remember well, this is by far my worst scored sleep I have ever recorded with this smartwatch: 36. I am not feeling particularly bad though.   

Today I am working full day from home. It is going to be a long day in front of my laptop.

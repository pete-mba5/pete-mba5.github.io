I went to run and swim in the early morning. It went good, but I am foreseeing a very crowded day in the pool. I will go again in the afternoon with Tim.   

I am afraid that the switch in the basement is breaking my internet connection. I need to test deeper. First I need to learn how to measure and then test with and without the swtich. I even have another PeE Mikrotik router available. I will include it into the test later.   

Yesterday evening I read something very interesting. In "Rational Optimist" the author considers agriculture as an advance in human history. In "Slow Productivity" the author considers hunting gathering tirbes less stressed. As usual, there are as many opinions as they are experts.

I finished the stoicism book. I liked it enough to get the Seneca's one.   

Today is the second part of the UX training.   

The teacher recommended a book and I purchased it. I am thrilling to read it.   

It is going to rain. I am going to bike to the office again.   

I do not know if the pool season is going to continue. I check in the webpage and the information is not clear to me.   

I have no clue which is the nintendo account that is consuming the subscription. What a chaos.

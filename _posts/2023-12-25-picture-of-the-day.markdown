I ran a great sugar cane round yesterday. Just 7km but gave me a sense of job done for the rest of the day.  

I slept significantly less and worse, but nevertheless, my HRV score is on the bottom of the scale.  

I promised Brauli to visit today McDonalds. Yes, today, for Cristmas.  

I finished the "Miracle Morning" and can say, that I do not like it. I am afraid that I will try to read only fiction very soon.  

Murakami's book is neither something I will remember forever. I will finish it.  

It was funny to finish Christmas Eve watching Sponge Bob with Tim. Maybe it will be a new familiy tradition. 

1 Spending time with my core family
2 I spent time in the kitchen cooking together with Tanja
3 Improve my soft skills
4 Finish the empathy Coursera course

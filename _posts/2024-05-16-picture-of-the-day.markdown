I have some knee pain on my left leg. Yesterday while walking after work, I felt a horrible flash in there. I had to stop walking and sit. Standing up was also painful. I feel this nok sensation while rotating my leg. I will observe it carefully. I have no clue what happened. I was able to run quite well, stretch, practice yoga and even do some strength leg exercises before this event.   

"Irresistible" is getting a little bit like a thriller novel. The bad news is that this is not a fiction one.   

My plan for today is bike to the office. Work until 6pm and go to swim in Durlach. Once I am back at home, I will evaluate what else can I physically do.   

I was investigating about github pages. It seems that I can run all my scripts there and even automate them. This is good news! I won't be needed to execute them every single day on my personal laptop.

Today was our last day in Castellar and to celebrate we wanted to book 1,5h at Salting. I still do not know why, but the clerk at the reception convinced me that 2h would be cheaper for us, because it also included jumping socks, that I did not need at all. Anyhow, we tried and I won. 15 mins before expiring our last bout, the kids were totally empty and soared.  

I will have a pleasant trip back to Germany, while my kids sleep and recover themselves. Mission accomplished.

I'm steadily cleaning up my todo list. By Sunday I will be done.  

I have read The Castafiore Emerald from the Adventures of Tintin and watched the documentary Unbreakable. It was about ultra running and although Kilian Jornet did not win, it was pretty amusing. I liked it a lot.  

The picture of the day was taken during my random running session. It is forcing  me to discover new places around here. For the time being I am just using a js to generate the coordinates, but I am thinking in automating the process.

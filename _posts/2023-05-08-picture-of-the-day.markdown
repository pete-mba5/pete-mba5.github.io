Beatiful Tulip found after parking my bike in the garage.  

I am not finding any trouble to run in the Zone 2. I will try to keep it for 6 weeks. Let's see if the baseline is improving as many experts say.  

I finished reading "Finding Ultra" by Rich Roll. I do not know what to think about it. I do not believe lots of things said in the book, but I enjoyed reading it.

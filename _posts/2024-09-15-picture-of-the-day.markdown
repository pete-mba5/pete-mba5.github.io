I ran my first 12km in weeks. I felt good. I met the marathonians. I totally forgot about the event. I took a picture and continued my run.   

While listening to a podcast, I discovered the next book I want to read. It is called "Breathe" from James Nestor. For the time being I am reading the Seneca's letters. To be very honest, I find most of them totally silly and boring. Let's see if this improves somewhow.

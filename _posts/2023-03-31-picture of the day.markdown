Well, it looks like I finally fixed the problems with the pagination and the pull requests from the terminal. From now on, I will be able to publish my photoblog on a daily base.  

I finished reading John Freeman's book The Tyranny of e-mail. It was a good reading. I learnt some things that will help me to manage my recovery time.  

Unfortunately I could not find any time for repotting all the plants I purchased last week. They still look great, but I can see the roots looking for more space. Without any excuse, this weekend this task needs to be completed, independently of the shitty weather we are having here.

Party is over. We were lucky on our way back home and did not get stuck in any traffic jam.  

All my plants survived my absense. Only the aloe vera suffered a little bit too much the rain excess.  

I am feeling now a little bit soared. I will start streching again tonight.  

I am almost done with the biohacking book.

Today is a very relaxed day. Everything happens at slow motion and it is ok.  

I am basically reading and playing.  

I am amazed how some waiters can remember us after one year.  

The weather is pretty good. It is mostly sunny with some clouds.  

No news from the garage so far. I will try to call the mechanic tomorrow. Let's see what he has to say.  

I would not cry if I have to stay at my parents for a couple more weeks, just waiting for the car to be repaired.

It has been a very hot day.   

I got a call from my landlord. His informer did his job. Next week he will visit me to evaluate the condition of my garten bushes. The drought is killing the tuja. I could not do more. Let's see what is the alternative he wants. For the time being, I am not going to transplant my 2 bushes as already planned. I will just wait and trim a little bit the mess.   

I swam around noon and was not a bad decision. The pool is getting crowded with that good weather.   

Tomorrow I am planning to go to the office.

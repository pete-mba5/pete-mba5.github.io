I have finished "Tocats pel Foc" de Manuel de Pedrolo. It has been a very good read. I liked a lot how the story is explained through different characters. One chapter for everyone, but the story progresses steadily.  

I ran until old appartment in Calafell. The village is totally changed. Some old businesses are still there but I could not identify a single old aquitance. All in all, I ran 25km and on my way back there was a horrible headwind.

I managed to improve my script for this daily page. I had to learn about the commands "sed" and "shuf".   
  
Word of the day is "darfst du, ja".  

I finished "Visita a la senyora Soler" from Manuel de Pedrolo and as usual with this autor, I liked it a lot.  

I started "Jesus' son" from Denis Johnson. I read 3 short stories and unfortunately I cannot say that I like it at all.

The random app brought me back to Wolfartsweier. Today it was very close to the Ernst-Schiele-HÃ¼tte.  

I finished the Secret of the Unicorn. It was like I reminded it, a masterpiece. Tomorrow I will read the Red Rackham's Treasure. 

I put Nonviolent Communication in the mix I am daily reading. Let's see.

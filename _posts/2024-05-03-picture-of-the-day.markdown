It has been a very productive morning today. I executed everything I had planned and one of they meetings was a complete success.   

Yesterday I finished the first chapter of "Cendra per Martina" by Manuel de Pedrolo. I liked it, but when I started the second one, where the same story is going to be explained by another character, I expecting even better moments.  

My morning run went pretty well. 100% zone 2 and average pace of 5:50min/km. I need to investigate a little bit deeper what is the Garmin performance score I am getting every day while running.  

Today we are going to the Opera to watch Tosta. It is going to be a great evening.

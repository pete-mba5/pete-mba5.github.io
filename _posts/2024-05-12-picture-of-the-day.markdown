Listening to a podast. They say, less agreeable people make more money. What a surprise.  

It is going to be a very hot day. Let's run immediately in the morning. I put my running clothes on the Sun to get them dry. A 12k run will suffice today.  

Yesterday at the pool, I met a guy that is working and living in Graz but was born and raised in the closest town to my village. What a funny coincidence. It was sad to see how fast you can forget your mothertonge.   

Yesterday evening I was reading a little bit more of the "intelligence" book from Max Bennet. I am liking it a lot.   

Today we will invest a big chunk of the day studying biology with my oldest son.

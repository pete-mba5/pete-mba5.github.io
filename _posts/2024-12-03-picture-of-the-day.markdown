I made it one more time. Another server running and another own domain mail service. I am happy for it. This time I troubleshooted by myself without needeing to execute external scripts.   

I am staying at home these two days. I need to work and train.   

I will conclude the migration tomorrow. I need to investigate whether the battery is getting drained bacuse OS is running on an external drive.

I slept very well today. According to Garmin, it was an 80%. I feel totally recovered.  

I am sharp and fresh. I completed the sudoku in 20mins.  

The weather is ugly again. Let's keep the poncho in the bike bag.  

Today will be the latest swim in Gr√∂tzingen during the week. Until end of June, we will be able to go there on Sundays only.  

Yesterday night I started a new book about the human brain. It is called "A brief history of intelligence" by Max Bennett. I liked it a lot.

I am still reading 'Boulder'. I do not get it at all but I will finish it. It is just to read something.  

I went to swim in the morning. I have noticed that since some weeks I am swimming at 1:41 quite steadily. I am pretty happy. Considering the amount of people we had in the lane, it is a success.  

Mosquitoes are back. Yesterday we did a barbecue in the garden. Today, my body is full of mosquito bites. I will look for my Autan in the afternoon.  

My school holidays are comming to an end. Tomorrow will be my last day. I am still doubting if I will work. I will decide it in the early morning.

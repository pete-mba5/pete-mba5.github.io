I will bike to the office with -5Â°C. I won't stop to take any picture of the day.  

I started reading a couple of beginner's books about bouldering. It is not very interesting yet.  

I found a DHL Packstation very close to my place. I can reach it just walking. It is in the hospital where Tim was born.

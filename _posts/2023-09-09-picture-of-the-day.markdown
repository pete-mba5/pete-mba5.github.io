I got the new terracotta pots for the plants and I have found some acrylic paints in the garage. Let's paint them!  

The new ASICS Gel-Kayano 28 are simply the most comfortable running shoes I have ever had. I will try to find in the second hand market some bargain.  

Just after 3 days of consistent stretching practice, I am starting to feel some change. Small steps in the right direction.  

Tomorrow I will run a half marathon with the Hoka and this will be their last run. 1000km has been more than enough for them and for my extremely squeezed feet. I will probably never bye a Hoka again. I need wider shoes and they are too narrow.

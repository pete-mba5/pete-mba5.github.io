Yesterday I found the right Tannengr√ºn for my Adventskranz. Just in time for the 4th round.  

Since today we want to prepare rabbit for lunch, I needed to find a tree stomp to cut it in pieces with the axe. I went with Tim and were very lucky to find the right piece for us.  

I will prepare a special dessert made with almond nougat. It is kind of a pudding with a Christmas touch.  

I keep reading, but since the whole core family is here, I am not dedicating that much time to this activity. I truly think that this is the right thing to do now.    

I learnt something in the self-help book "Miracle Morning". The Author's journaling method is as follows: list what you are greatful for, acknowledge my accomplishments, clarify which areas I want to improve and finally planning specific actions I am committed to take to improve. Let's see if I will use it somewhen.

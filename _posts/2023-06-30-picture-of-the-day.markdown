I am recovered from yesterday's lactate test.  

I have read Tintin in the land of the Soviets. I cannot recall that I have read it when I was a child. I liked it. It was the first Tintin ever written. 

Today is the first and only day of this week, that I am working from home. It has been a tough one.

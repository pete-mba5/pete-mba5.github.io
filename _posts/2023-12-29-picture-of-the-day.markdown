I changed a little bit the routine and I am managing the journal in the afternoon.  

The morning run was excellent with Sun and a cold breeze. Perfect weather for running.  

1 Being relatively healthy. I can physically do whatever I want.  
2 I installed Brauli's monitor in Tim's room. It was not valid for gaming, but looks great here and I can also use it for home office.  
3 Improve my soft skills  
4 Finish the empathy Coursera course. Try accessing the corporate account from my private devices.

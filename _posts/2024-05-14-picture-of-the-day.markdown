I'm working in Suttgart today.   

I am tired.   

Today it is going to be a long day of work and I won't swim. I will run in the late afternoon or evening.   

I listened to a podcast about to do lists. I will read the book of the guest. It was from a google manager. It was nothing new. It sounded like the getting things done.

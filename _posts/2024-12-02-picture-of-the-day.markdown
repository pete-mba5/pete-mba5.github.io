I am still here. I could not progress as much as I wanted during the weekend.   

Yesterday was a good day. I collected one big and nice pot for my elephant ear plant. I also cut massively the unwanted tree in the backyard.   

I found some time to read my current book and I enjoyed a lot.   

Today I am planning to bike to the office and in the afternoon swim a little bit with the turtles.

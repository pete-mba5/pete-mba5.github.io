I was too late to capture the crane and the rower in this nice scenery.  

The marathon went ok. I ran it 5mins faster than last time. No drinks, no gels, no eating and no music. Mission accomplished. My general feeling was very good. In a couple more iterations I should be able to push my pace to 4:45 and 4:40. I think that by the end of 2024 I should be able to run below 4:30min/km without any specific training, simply running every day.

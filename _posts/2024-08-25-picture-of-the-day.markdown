It rained all night.  

Today I am also soared in the legs. I trained them yesterday. Today I will do back and swim. The weather is good for an empty pool. Let's see what I find.   

I am reading a book called "Focus on what matters". I am liking it. I like this short sentences style.   

Yesterday evening, while watching a very boring sci-fi film, I reached strechting for 3mins every exercise of my routine. I thought that maybe would be better to lay on the floor stretching instead of sitting on the couch. When I finished the routine, I shut off the beamer and went upstairs to read a little bit and sleep.   

I will investigate if more time is better for static stretching.

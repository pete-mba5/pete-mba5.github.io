It is wonderful sunny day.   

We are planning to go to the cinema to watch Dune 2.  

I am still reading Richard Feynman's book.  

Pictures from my last marathon are available online.  

I kept busy doing small things at home and playing with my kids.  

I purchased new dahlia bulbs and a repair set for the lawn. This will be my last try.  

It was too windy today to try again the mile challenge. I will do it tomorrow.  

Yesterday night I watched the documentary about Kilian Jornet in the Everest. I liked it a lot.

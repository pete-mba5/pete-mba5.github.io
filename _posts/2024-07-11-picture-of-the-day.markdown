It was a weird day. I changed my mind three times about going to Stuttgart and enjoy the company concert. In the end, I decided not to go and stay at home gardening. I made a lot of progress.   

I finally could take a picture of myself with my jelly fish shirts. Tomorrow I will send a message to the artist. I am very happy with the final results. She did an excellent job.   

I will read a little bit more of "a brief history of intelligence".   

I went to the pool and due to the good weather, it was very crowded. My plan for tomorrow is going at 9am.

7.7 time for Tour de France.   

The weather turned well again. I went to the pool. The master told me that tomorrow we are coming back to 17Â°C again. Funny summer this year.   

Some people were still talking about football. I do not care at all. I swam well today. I am happy.   

I read in Scott Adams' book an interesting chapter about being a good conversionalist. Of course, he did not discribed any process for excelling, but at least he has waken up some interest into this subject. Maybe it will be a next read.

It is raining.   

Maybe I'll have to change the plan for today.   

Yesterday I got bored with the Jamaican boy read and started the "Prophet Song" by Paul Lynch. It is ok so far.   

Just after my early morning run starts a heavy rain. Perfect timing to cool down, but what will happen with swimming today?

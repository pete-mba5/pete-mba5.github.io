It is raining.   

Maybe I'll have to change the plan for today.   

Yesterday I got bored with the Jamaican boy read and started the "Prophet Song" by Paul Lynch. It is ok so far.   

Just after my early morning run starts a heavy rain. Perfect timing to cool down, but what will happen with swimming today?   

I went to swim and turned to be one of the best lately. I swam very focused on the style. Trying to slide over water. I liked it and was not slow at all. When around the 300m I started to feel the workout in my shoulders, I started to run a little bit faster.  

We were just 2 people in every lane. We are very privileged for these swimming facilities.

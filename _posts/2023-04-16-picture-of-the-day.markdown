It was a slow trip. Close to the French border, heavy winds hit us and they were with us until well passed Lyon.  

Once the wind stopped, the rain showed up. It was impossible to get bored on the wheel.  

When we arried at home it was 5:30am and there were lots of birds chirping before the Sun came. It was really loud. Even with the ar windows closed and the radio on, I was able to listen to them.  

I slept 8h and stood up to organize everything we brought here.

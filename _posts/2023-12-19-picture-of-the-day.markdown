I started reading the "Miracle Morning". I have almost the half and my first impression is that it is very repetitive. Let's see when he explains the methodology if it improves.  

I went for a walk after dinner and felt really ok. I took the opportunity to call my parents and this fit well. It was tempting to have something to eat while watching a little bit of TV, but I made it. If my calculations are correct, I matched not eating 3h before sleeping. Let's see how far can I go with this.  

Yesterday's run with the Sun was excellent. I liked delaying business activities to the darker part of the day.  

I managed to purchase a couple of last minute gifts and also all the accessories needed for the new Samsung monitor. I also bid for a ASSC Tee for Brauli. Let's see how it will be. This is my first purchase through StockX.

I am going to title all the next Pictures with the diceware method. It is funny and I do not have to think at all.

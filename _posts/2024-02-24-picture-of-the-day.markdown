I have a new mission for the Pflanzenklauer.   

I am having ankle pain again in both feet.  

Yesterday we were very lucky with the traffic.   

I am wondering my strategy for cell phones. I am almost convinced that I will keep the prepaid ones and will use the company duplicate for the 4G router.

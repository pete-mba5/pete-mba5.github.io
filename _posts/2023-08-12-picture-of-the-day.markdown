Kids have broken the iPad 9th Generation digitizer screen. The device is fully functional but does not look that great anymore. I will instruct myself for a future repair. I will purchase a screen plastic protection.  

I am reading the Crab with the Golden Claws. I also started reading David Deutsch's The Beginning of Infinity,

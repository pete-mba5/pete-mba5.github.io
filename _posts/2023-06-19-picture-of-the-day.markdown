I am executing my garden project with Lavandula Agustifolia. The main problem yesterday were the bees, but I could manage without being attacked. Today I will do  the second part of the harvest.  

I am not progressing as fast as expected with David Deutsch book. It is interesting but way too long. Let's see how I will continue with it.

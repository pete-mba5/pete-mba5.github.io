The plan for today is driving to Strassburg and visit a shoe store with a very new and specific model. Let's see how lucky we will be.   

My car is making some strange noise again. No clue what this could be. I really hope it is not the turbo. It happens at low rpm while moving. I read a little bit in internet and got a little bit scared. Fingers crossed.

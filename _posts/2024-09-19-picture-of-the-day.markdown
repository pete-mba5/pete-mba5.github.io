I went to the ophtalmologist. I need readers. 1.5% is what is suiting best for me now. Let's see how fast I will age from now on.   

I am a little bit sad about how the system works. I spent one hour there. I got nothing. No paper stating my sight status. The doctor told me to go to the optician to the the eyes measured again and get the readers being built. On the other hand she said that reading glasses have identical lenses. I do not get it. I do not have perfect sight. One of my eyes has an impair of 0.25. Why will I get exactly same lenses in the readers? Finally she recommended to go to a supermarket and try and pick what suits me better. As far as I am not feeling any pain, she cannot do anything for me. Absolutely crazy.

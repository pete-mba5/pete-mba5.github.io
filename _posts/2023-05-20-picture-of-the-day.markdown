We went to the Sprungbude in Filderstadt. It is located around 100km away from home. When we were in front of the reception desk, ready to purchase our tickets, I realized that I had forgotten my wallet. I had also forgotten
my cellphone with the passwords. I only had my newest phone that still does not have all the applications, cards, etc. The card in the watch was not verified and while trying to finish the process I realized that I cannot remember my password. I tried to purchase the ticket over the online shop. They do not have paypal available. In a desperate try, I selected direct transfer, I still do not know how, but the cellphone opened one banking app, asked me for a password I could remember and paid the tickets. The day was saved! From this point on, everything went better as expected. The place was not crowded, we could enjoy swtiching from station to station whitout having to wait a single bit.

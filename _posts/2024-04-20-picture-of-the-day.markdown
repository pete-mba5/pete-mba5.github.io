I slept at 87% Garmin quality rate. It is not bad.  

The temperature dropped a lot. It is cold again.  

The plan for today, in case it is not raining, is going to play basketball and study a little bit of history and physics.  

Somehow I am losing interest in Naomi's book "The Future". Let's see what is going to come next.  

My youngest kid got some throat ache. I really hope that this is not again a cold or flu.

I finished my Pegasus 36 running shoes. They have been by far the best of the series. In case I find a sale on internet for this precise model, I would need a bigger size US 10,5.

We could not watch the film yesterday. It was FSK16 and my kids are not old enough. We went to eat a Deliburgers. They were happy too.   

I read a little bit more from the breathing book. I took a weird note "too much oxygen in my body wouldn't help me but hurt me". Another one was "it's a method our bodies use to stay balanced and grounded to the rhythms of the cosmos". We I read this, I rolled my eyes and thought immediately, Bullshit. I kept reading. In this book the author mentions "the eye of revelation". I will read it too.   

I will paint the black garden door today.

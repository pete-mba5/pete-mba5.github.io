I recorded timestamps of all my yesterday's activities. I will do the same today.  

I finished "Mossegar-se la cua" d'en Pedrolo. I liked it, specially when the investigators tell one of the complices to go to study for the last course after he confeses everything. I had to laugh loud in the middle of the night.   

It is really cold out there. I need good 7k to get warm and start to pace at a normal speed while running.  

I look for the Elite controller invoice without any success. I have no clue where I purchased it.   

I installed the NEC screen in the basement, together with the Pi400.   

My HFV is getting back to normal. Today I just scored a 9.

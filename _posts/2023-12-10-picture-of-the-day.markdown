I ran the half marathon in zone 2. It was hard to run below 155bpm. I am afraid that the HR sensor of my FR945 is not ok. Next Sunday I will repeat it with both watches, Fenix3 + cheststrap and FR945. Let's see which one is saying what.   

1:42 for a zone 2 half marathon sounds pretty okay for me.  

Thanks to Strava Labs and the Flyby, I have found a runner I met today.  

I am feeling strong, but the fact that I am lately only running 10k, has had an impact.

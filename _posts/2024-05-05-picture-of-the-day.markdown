We made it happen. We woke up early in the morning and went to swim our 1000m again Tim is improving a lot. One can notice it week by week.   

I read almost one hour yesterday evening. It is really interesting how different can things be when the narrator is a another person. I like this book. I am thrilling for the chapter with the third protagonist.  

My dad is going to finish within the next week all the books I had purchsased him. I have to look for new titles for his pipeline.   

Today is not shiny, but my kids asked me for a barbecue and they will get it. One man, one word.

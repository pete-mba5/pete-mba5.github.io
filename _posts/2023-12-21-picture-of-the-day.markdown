I am still reading Murakami's book. I like it and cannot believe that I have forgotten almost everything in it.  

I enjoyed a parallel department Christmas dinner. It was a very good one. We enjoyed a good dinner and conversation. I went by bike and got soaked to the bones. This week I am having a lot of luck with the rain.  

When I came back home at 1am, my kids were waiting for me. They wanted me to prepare a couple of self made pizzas. No problem, everything was ready before hand.

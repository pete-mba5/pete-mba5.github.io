I brought the car to the garage. They will service it and repair the noise from the wheel. It has to be the bearing.  

While running in the afternoon, I passed by and Aleix, the owner, confirmed that it was the bearing what was producing the noise. It will be delivered tomorrow and installed immediately. Very good service.  

To celebrate the good news, I decided to run a little bit longer than usual and headed to "La Mola", the highest peak in the province.  It was nice, but the roads were so full of stones that it was not always easy to run.  

For lunch, we had an excellent rice with artichokes and cod. In the early afternoon we played a beach volley match and surprisingly the kids have beaten us. They are growing faster than it looks like.

I listened in a podcast some people saying that they do not listen to music. I cannot believe it.  

"The Future" is getting a little bit better. I am now at 36% of it and kind of liking how it evolves.  

I read how to quickly deteriorate the iPhone battery, I am going to test for a couple of weeks.  

The experiment with crunchyroll did not work ok. I tried to test the premium account with a temp email. It looks like the only grant you this privilege if you provide a credit card. I need another approach.  

Yesterday I was attacked by a dog while running. It was a matter of time. Too many people walking the dog unleashed.

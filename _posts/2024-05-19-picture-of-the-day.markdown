I am dealing with an artist for my new T-shirts. I am really excited about the results.  

Yesterday I went to Strassburg with my oldest one. He was looking for new Jordans. They were sold out everywhere. We walk a lot. It was a beautiful day together.   

Once back at home, I had enough time to mow the lawn. Just before the rain started again. I am proud of myself.  

No clue what I am going to do today. Tomorrow I will drive for 14h to my brithplace.

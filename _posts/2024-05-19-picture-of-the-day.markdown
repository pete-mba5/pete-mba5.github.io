I am dealing with an artist for my new T-shirts. I am really excited about the results.  

Yesterday I went to Strassburg with my oldest one. He was looking for new Jordans. They were sold out everywhere. We walk a lot. It was a beautiful day together.   

Once back at home, I had enough time to mow the lawn. Just before the rain started again. I am proud of myself.  

No clue what I am going to do today. Tomorrow I will drive for 14h to my brithplace.  

Random thought from running: research knot for the bush, I crossed 2 ladies and 1 man today. Very few people running today in the forest. I would probably hide my strava profile experimentally for a couple of weeks. I have to accomodate all the plants inside the house to avoid birds, cats attacks. Write an email to the garage at the camping village. I case he has time, I would like him to fix everything in the car. Empty Rimowa for bringing LP's to Germany. An alternative would be the self made wooden cabinet. Will I have enough space? I doubt it.

My car was repaired and serviced. All in all, I paid less than the half I am usually paying in Germany.  

Since my heel is still bleeding and had no much time to run in the evening, I decided to run barefoot on the shore. I will probably do the same today. It was a good experience although I could not run fast.  

I discovered how the automatic drop watering system is working in the camping. It is manually operated, what a disappointment.

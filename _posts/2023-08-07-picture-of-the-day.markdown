I have finished the Broken Ear. It was ok.  

I am reading a couple of books in parallel.  

I finalized the Brompton repair and started the Olov rear brake fix.  

I discovered Randonautica. It looks like a funny thing to integrate in my daily routine. Could be that I combine this with the picture of the day.

I discovered a new way to have a blog managed by bash. I will investigate deeper and try to test it.  

Because of a late meeting I could not go to swim. It is not a big deal because on Monday is really hard to swim, but anyways it hurt.   

I started a new cycle of TWYOB. As usual, next day I will be soared.  

I read another chapter of Feynman's book.

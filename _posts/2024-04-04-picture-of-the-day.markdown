Last night I finished the biohacking book. I am happy. I won't apply anything from it. Now it is time to forget it.  

I requested a repaid card from Lebara. I would say that 5GB/month is enough for me. Dowload speed does not make any difference for me. The call minutes to the foreign countries was an interesting option.  

I went to swim in the early morning. It went very well. The pro did not pass me any single time. I am getting faster and stronger while swimming.  

I have to bring my car to the MOT and purchase a LED light that got broken yesterday evening.  

On Saturday the temperature is going to finally go up. It is raining and cannot do anything at all in the garden.  

The couch needs a renewal. Let's see what I will finally do.

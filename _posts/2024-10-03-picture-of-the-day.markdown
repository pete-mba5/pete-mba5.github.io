Today is Germany's National Day.   
I went to run a little bit in the forest. I am still trying to focus on nasal breathing. It is hard but I am able to manage for 5-7km.   
I did my TWYOB and stretching routine.   
I am barely reading these days. Just a Seneca's letter each day for the last week. I am really busy with the kids' chores. Anyhow, I cannot complaint. I am really happy doing them.

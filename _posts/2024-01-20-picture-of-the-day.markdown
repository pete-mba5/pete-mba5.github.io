The Sun is shining again. Everything is covered with a layer of snow.   

I am going to run, if possible, whethever the sunlight is reaching me. Today I am not going to the forest.   


The Harvard Business Review about crypto I am reading now was published in 2021 and it looks like it was done hundred years ago. It is so outdated that makes me laugh while reading it.

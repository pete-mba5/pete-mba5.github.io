We went yesterday to watch the last Spiderman film. It was good. I liked it a lot, but the end was a trap.  

The Elite 2 controller arrived and according to Brauli it is defective. I will need to invest today some time into the analysis.  

I re-read "Tintin in the Congo". It was an uncolored version. When I was a child, I remember it was a colorful version. I liked it a lot.  

I reached the multiverse chapter in David Deutsch book. Funny coincidence with Spiderman film.

I woke up very tired today. I just went to run and kept the rest of the day doing very few things. It was ok, because I had no previous plan for today.   

I am mainly reading the Balaji's book. Yesterday evening I could not continue reading a little bit of the 4 books I have lately started. I was mentally exhausted.   

I cooked a very easy and fast Pak Choi dish. I was very impressed about the results.

Today and tomorrow will be hot days. I will condense my activities in the early morning. The pool was crowded, but I could swim pretty well. I took the right decision and tomorrow I have to do the same. 9am at the main entrance.  

The plan for today is challenging.   

I read something about living on autopilot. It could be interesting for the boring stuff.   

The noise on my left ear is making me crazy. Since yesterday it is even painful. I went to the doctor and could not see anything wrong, but recommended to go to the specialist. I have an appointment for next Monday morning.     

I used again the airpods v2 and they fit better in my ear. I will avoid the v3 for a while.  

I will try to finish Scott Adams' book today. It is very hot and I am afraid that won't be easy to sleep.

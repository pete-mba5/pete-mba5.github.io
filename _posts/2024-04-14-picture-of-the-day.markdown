We arrived to the pool four minutes too late. Surprisingly, nobody said anything and we were allowed to enter and swim a little bit. It was a big success for Tim and myself.   

We went to run with the kids for 4km. It was ok. Let's see the cramps next day.  

I read a little bit more of the book "the Future" from Naomi Alderman. I am liking it for the time being.   

I transferred some plants from the pot to the garden. One in the front and the other in the back.  

Brauli could be a barbecue master. He ran the second event and the results were extraordinry. Everybody was very pleased with the perfectly cooked entrecotes.

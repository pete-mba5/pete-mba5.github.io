I failed to pass the HU. The technician was sick and the business closed.  

I repaired the first part of the lawn.  

I read a nice article about journalism. I won't apply it. It is offline. Not my idea.  

Today I will finish "Once upon a prime". This is a very good book. I enjoyed it a lot.  

I am planning to have a barbecue tomorrow. Let's see.

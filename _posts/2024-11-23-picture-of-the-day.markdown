Today we will have our first handball match with Tim. He is excited. I am just stretching. It is cold out there. I discarded to run before the match. I will do it during the lunch time.   

I kept reading Harari's book, but I am a little bit stuck. I am finding these pages quite boring and after 10mins I fall asleep.   

Yesterday I ate something wrong. I woke up around 3am with a heavy sense of acidity in my mouth. After some nutella, I am feeling better now.   

Bitcoin almost reach 100000USD yesterday. Crazy. The best part of it is, I really do not understand the reasoning of this pricing. I have read some books about crypto though.

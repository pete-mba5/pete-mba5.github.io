Back to normal. It rains now. I went to the pool and we were just 4 people swimming.  

I talked to the clerk at the pool and yes, it was completely full. I am happy that I took the decision to stay at home.   

I was reading a little bit more of a Brief history of Intelligence. I am liking it a lot.   

Germany won against Denmark. It was good match, but I was too tired and could not watch it live.

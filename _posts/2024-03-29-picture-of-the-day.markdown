For the first time in my life I have experienced being stuck in the mointain. They closed the connection to our valley due to high winds. We had to go down to a different valley and commute by bus to our car. It took us more than 2 hours.  

It was a good day, but around noon, the temperature was too high and the snow was extremely wet and sticky. Nevertheless we had a great day skiing together.   

I ran to the black lake again. It is a nice flat circuit. Today without wind or snow, was even nicer.  

Tomorrow's forecast is not very good. There is a wind alert. Let's see what can we do.  

I am still reading the boring book. Less than the half is missing. I am going to combine this penitency with some other fiction book.

It was another hot day and even the birds are looking for shadows.  

I read Flight 714 to Sydney from The Adventures of Tintin. I am pretty sure I did not understand anything when I read it before. I was way too young for this story. Now, I am able to understand and enjoy it. It was a very good one for me.

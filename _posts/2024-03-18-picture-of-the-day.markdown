I had to briefly run in the early morning and was not that bad. Of course it was way shorter than desired, but sometimes we do not have another choice.  

I had another Flammkuchen today and my stomach is now aching.  

The pool was not that crowded today. Maybe people are really starting to go to Sonnenbad too. This facility just opened last Friday.  

I read a little bit more of Feynman's book. Now it is starting to be interesting.

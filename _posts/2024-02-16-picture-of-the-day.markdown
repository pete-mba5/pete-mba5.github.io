Today im turning 50 years old. Yesterday night arrived my mom and youngest sister. This was a big and unexpected surprise. We will continue celebrating today. I am happy.   

I am enjoying Pedrolo's book. It is normal with this author.   

My heel is better today.  

Yesterday afternoon I was exploring the Google Photos API. It could be that I will try something for my journal project with it.  

I took the day off. I will enjoy it from now on.

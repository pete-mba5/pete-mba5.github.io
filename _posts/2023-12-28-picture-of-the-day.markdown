Yesterday during the run I was thinking about what I think while running. It is a lot and very diverse. It is like trying to meditate. My thoughts are jumping all over. I run without headsets since months and I am not missing it. I mostly run without any specific target and this means that I do not need to check the watch every 15seconds. The other day I was running for 800m behind a man that checked his watch 10 times. After the run I checked that the pace we had by then was around 4:15. I was a little bit faster, since I was overtaking him. Checking the watch 10 times in 3mins is a lot. It is checking your wrist every 18secs. How can you focus on running if you are fixing your arm, moving your neck, stop seeing in front of you, etc. Anyhow, this is one of the things I wonder while running. Observe the environment, count things like number of people walking, dogs, eagles and do calculations.   

I am getting stronger. Yesterday I was able to do 3 series of pull-ups in the garden. Number of reps as follows: 9, 8 and 7. It is like a miracle. One thing that I am missing is the grip strenght. By the end of the series, more than pain in my back, I felt a poor grip to the bar. It is much more difficult to pull up when you are hanging from your fingertips.  

The plan for today is having a tasty Delibrugers all together and play some more football in the muddy playground. The Sun is not to be seen today with so many clouds thus I believe that I will run again in the forest. I will probably do my sugar cane protocol.  

Since it is raining, I had to change the plan and simply run a zone 2 11k. For the second day this week, I have seen one of the NABU 'Vogel des Jahres'. Today I saw a Gr√ºnspecht.

1 The place I am living and the life I have  
2 Playing 2h football with my 8yo kid  
3 Improve my soft skills  
4 Finish the empathy Coursera course. I will fulfil one lesson a day

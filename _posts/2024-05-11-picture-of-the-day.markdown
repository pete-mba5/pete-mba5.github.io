I am having a headache. Maybe too much sun, yesterday.  

We went to the Freibad and had a great time with Timmy. There was almost no one. The plan for today is to get our pictures done and purchase the family season card.   

Swimming again in a 50m pool is a weird story. I felt like I was not progressing as fast as I am usually doing in the 25m one.  

Although I felt that I was swimming slow, I made my 1000m easily. When I checked the record, It has been almost 12s slower per 100m. I was wrecked. What a poor performance...   

Let's see what I will do today.

It has been a very cold day, but we had some luck and the Sun shinned a little bit in the early afternoon.   

I am still wondering about the blog in the openBSD server. On the one hand is challenging to learn something new. On the other, migrating this jekyll static website is tempting me. I really do not know what I will do. Another element is the SSD. I want to switch to another one.

This was a big surprise. I had no idea that this cactus will blossom. My mom has had the mother plant for 30 years and never saw a flower. I am lucky.  

I finished the "Fabric of Reality" by David Deutsch. It was very interesting, but I am afraid I won't live enough to see the eventual confirmation of his theories.

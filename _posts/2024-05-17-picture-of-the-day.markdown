It has been a very productive day. I finished some important things. This made me very happy.   

All the time invested preparing my son's exams payed off. He got a 1-2 in history. Seeing his proud and happiness made my day. We went to the city to have a burger and explore some sport shoes.   

It rained the whole day. Anyhow, I went to run a very short 3 miler rount. I got soaked to the bones.  

I am still struggling with my neck and my knees. No clue what this is, but it is painful.

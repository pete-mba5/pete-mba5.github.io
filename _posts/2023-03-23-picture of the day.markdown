Freestyling with Lego.  

I could not find time today to build another Kevin Hall robot. I have completed almost all the challenges from the book. There are only 3 more and 1 is impossible since I am lacking lots of special parts.  

Tomorrow we have a math exam and we needed to review a little bit all the exercices again. It went quite ok, let's hope for some good luck.  

Now it is time to go the bed and read another 10% more of the book I started two days ago. So far it is not a very thrilling one, but I am hoping that will improve in the next chapter. Fingers crossed.

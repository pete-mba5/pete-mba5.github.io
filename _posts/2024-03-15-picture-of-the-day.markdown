It was a very productive day. I cleaned up my pile very deeply.   

I was still sored on the legs.  

I continued reading Feynman's book. The chapter about conservation of the energy is simply boring. I learned nothing new.   

Saturday is the last day of life of the continuous glucose monitor. I will try to run a half marathon to check what happens. I am not going to take breakfast or dring anything but a coffee.  

For the time being BonBon is working well.

Yesterday I watched "the Weather man" and I liked it a lot. I found it hilarious and some quotes were really crazy:  
  
Viewer : What kind of name is Spritz? It's a bullshit name. It's a TV name. He's bullshit.
Viewer's Wife : Well, I like him. He's handsome.
Viewer : He's an asshole. I don't like his face. His asshole face.

I went to run with the water rucksack. It went ok. It will help during the Summer runs. I can carry more than 1l of water in total and the cellphone.  

Today may applewatch battery drained 2km before finishing my training. Strangely, the training was not lost and could sync with Strava what was recorded.

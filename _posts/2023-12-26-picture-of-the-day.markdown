We are going together to the theater.   

My HRV remains at the bottom. My sleep score is still average. I am feeling physically strong. I will maybe run an 11k round and later train my legs at home.  

I really do not know when are we going to play football with Tim. The agenda is today a little bit tight and the daylight still scarce.  

I am progressing reading Murakami's book. I'm am highlighting some sentences but in general, I would say that I do not like it so much.

1 Loving kids  
2 I went to McDonalds with my kids  
3 Improve my soft skills  
4 Finish the empathy Coursera course

I practiced yoga in the early morning. It was harder than before. I feel that I lost some flexibility. My stretchin plan is not covering everything. I will try to keep it as a daily routine.   

Yesterday evening I read half an hour of Pedrolo's book "Cendra per Martina". When I was done, I played 15mins Metroid Dread in my Nintendo Switch. I am very rusty. They killed me. I need to recall all the moves, attacks and tricks. It is a long way in front of me.  

Today is the last day before the Wasen 2024. I am a little bit scared. Fingers crossed.

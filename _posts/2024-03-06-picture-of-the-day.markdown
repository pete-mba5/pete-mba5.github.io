It rained a lot again in the afternoon and arrived home after the swimming totally soaked.  

I finished Carlo Rovelli's book "Seven brief lessons on Physics". It was very short but interesting. I cannot say that I learned anything new, but refreshed some stuff from my University times.  

It is nice to see how people I meet every time I am going to the pool are smiling to me or even starting to talk to me.

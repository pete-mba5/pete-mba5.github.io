I slept bad. Short and horrible quality. I had dinner very late.  

I enjoyed a late bike ride with Brauli.  

Yesterday I went to the pool at 10am and it was a little bit too late. I will try to go at 9am today.   

I am at 70% of "Slow Productivity". I am surprised how fast I am reading it. Yesterday night after the read I was thinking a little bit about the book. It is not one of my favorite ones.

I invested a lot of time instructing myself in authentication, encryption, hashing and password managers. I will keep my passwords in a piece of paper for the time being.  

I went to run again with the Hokas and I am pretty convinced that my right foot has increased in width. It is so painful running with them, that I have to stop it now. I have ran with them 900km, thus it is a good moment to scrap them, although they are pretty new yet.  

Maybe in the future I will only be able to run with Altras. Nike and Adidas are also very narrow.  

I need to mix some sand with my pot plants substrat, otherwise they will die soon.

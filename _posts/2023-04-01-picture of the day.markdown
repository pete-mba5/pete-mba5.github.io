This is the last robot from Kevin Hall's book: Roboter 30 Ideen mit LEGO Steinen. I will investigate if there is some community online where to get inspired building more LEGO robots.

It is time to think in a new subject for the picture of the day. Spring is coming to Germany and I am quite sure that flowers, blossom, plants, nature will be the focus of this activity. 

I have also finished in the early morning Manuel de Pedrolo's book: Domicili Provisional. It was a fiction funny quick read that I enjoyed a lot.  

Today I will go to the Opera to enjoy the Flying Dutch. I was looking forward for this appointment since Christmas 2022. Let's see how good will be the experience.

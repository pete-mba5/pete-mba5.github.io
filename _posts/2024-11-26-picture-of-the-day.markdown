I have a problem with the new domain and the coniguration of the SMTP service. I will run the script again. I checked the algorithm, but I really do not understand it.   

I read a little bit of the crypto book. I like it more than the last one. For the time being it is just eplaining some basics about money and some historical background.   

I have pain in my right foot again. It is not always aching, but just when I land in a particular part of it while running. In the day to day life, it is not a big deal.   

I have researched a little bit about new cars. It looks like nowadays, you do not need to purchase a diesel anymore. I did some analysis and it resulted just 70â‚¬ more per year for the gas.

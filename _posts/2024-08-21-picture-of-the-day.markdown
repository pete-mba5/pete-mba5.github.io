I am listening to a podcast. I like the subject, the content, but I dislike how the guy laughs continuously. There is absolutely nothing to laugh at. Anyhow, I will try to listen to it again and extract the good advice.   

It is raining. It wasn't in my plan. I will get wet.   

It does not matter how early you wake up. There is always someone else that woke up earlier.

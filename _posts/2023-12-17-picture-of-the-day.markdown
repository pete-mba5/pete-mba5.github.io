I tried to make mGBA work in the 2DS. I tried three different builds. Maybe I need to check or update the Homebrew.  

Today is very cold but sunny, It will be fun running a little bit.  

Tim is not waking up thus we will probably skip going to pool in the morning.  

Yesterday we went to Deliburger and Weihnachtsmarkt. Brauli stayed alone for 40mins finishing his burger, while Tim and myself went to pick up a Zuckerwatte.  

I am still feeling the noise in my head. It all started on Wednesday during a run, two weeks ago.  

While running, I remembered that I want to reread Murakami's book about running. I already marked it as new in my kindle.

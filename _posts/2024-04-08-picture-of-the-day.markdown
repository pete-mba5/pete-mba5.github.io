I performed my forelast session of reading 'Boulder'. Today I will finish it and tomorrow I won't remember anything from it.  

I am planning to finish a couple of running shoes in the next weeks. It will be a little bit painful since they are 0 drop, but I cannot see them any more in my cabinet. I will complete the 1000km mark and dispose them.  

I will have a pizza today.  

Tonight I have a plant mission.

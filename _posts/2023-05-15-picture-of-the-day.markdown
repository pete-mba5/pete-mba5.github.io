We were invited to have an after-work dinner at the Rakia Raketa Bar in Sofia.   

While walking from ther hotel to the restaurant, I took several pictures of magnificent buildings, parks, temples, churches, a synagoge and even a mosque. Unfortunately none of them will be published and will remain stored and maybe forgotten in my hard disk drive.   

Today's picture of the day has been totally unexpected.

I could finally clean up my crowded inbox. I am back to the status I was before my last holidays.  

While working a little bit in the garden, I discovered that my Edelseiss is not dead. Tomorrow I will clean up the place in order to allow more Sun exposure. Let's see how it likes it.  

The test I did with the Dell DisplayLink was positive. I still have to wait for the power supply I purchased from Amazon. xBox series S and workstation can now coexist in the same desk at Brauli's room.  

David Deutsch's book is taking more time than expected. Not a big deal, I am enjoying the read a lot.

I found a dead mole in my garden. It was a tiny one. Probably a baby. These cats that come to my garden to poo have killed him. Motherfuckers.  

I completed another 12k with nasal breathing only. My throat is suffering but I am able to made it at 8mins/mile. I am happy although I do not perceive any effect.   

I am reading the newest Harari book, in parallel with the Seneca letters. I find the letters a little bit too dry to read for hours.

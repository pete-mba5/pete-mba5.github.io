Pretty well done. I could find all the parts quickly and assembled it in a second.
I finished "Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds" by David Goggins. At times it was a hard read. I liked it overall although I have no interests in any of the topics developed in the book. I found really interesting the advice provided at the end of the chapters. I liked how he puts you in front of the mirror when we say that we do not have enough time to do whatever we want. There is no place for cheap excuses.

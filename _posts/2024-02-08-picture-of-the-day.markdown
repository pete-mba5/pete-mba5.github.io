I was alone in the office.  

For the first time in weeks, I was able to swim my 1000m without interruption. There was another guy in my lane, but he was very kind of not blocking me at all. In the end, I was able to pace at 1:41. Considering the fact that I am not allowed to turn, it is a great result for me. I am very happy.  

The rain is not stopping.

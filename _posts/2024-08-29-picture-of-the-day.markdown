I am back home. I drove all night. The car is still ok. One stone impacted the windshield. Today I have to check it.   

It took us 11:15h of driving time. It was faster without rain.  

It does not matter if I drive during the day or the nights, my kids are not sleeping at all.   

The portable router from Tenda was not that bad. It gave us a very stable and fast internet all the way.   

Barca Stadium "Camp Nou" is still not finished. I really do not know if my kids would like to watch a match in the Barcelona Olympic Stadium instead.

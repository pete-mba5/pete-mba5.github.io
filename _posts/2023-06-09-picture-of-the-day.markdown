I learnt to install raspbian light in my very old raspberry B. Now I am playing with SSH and later will install a static webpage with Jekyll.

I have already learnt about Randonautica and I would like to know more.  

I have already learnt about Diceware and I have ran my first test. I like it.  

Listened in a podcast: "70% of people are not satisfied at all at work". WOW.   

I started to watch "John Wick 4" and like the quote "a good death only comes after a good life". I stopped it and went to sleep.

The mountain was closed for almost three hours due to heavy winds. When they opened we went to the top and we were almost alone. It was our last day and it was epic. We did everything and all the pistes were in excellent condition. There were no bumps anywhere.  

While we were descending our last piste, it started raining a lot. The temperature was not cold enough and we got soaked to the bones. We were so happy in the heated lift to the top. Once there, the temperature droped and the water was almost automatically converted into snow. We had got enough for our last day. It was a great day. We were totally happy.  

I ran again to the Black Lake. Half a mile too much. I got cought by the rain again.  

Dinner was pretty ok. I had chicken.  

82% sleep quality.

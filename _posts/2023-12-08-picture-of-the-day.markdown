I am reading Outlive by Peter Attia. I am happy to learn that most of the things I am doing are also prescribed in the book.  

This week the weather will be better and I am putting the plants outside again. They survived the low temperatures inside.  

I am sticking with the stretching practice and I am noticing the effects. I am more flexible.

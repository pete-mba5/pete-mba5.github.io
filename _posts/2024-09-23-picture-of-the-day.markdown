I am feeling a little bit sick. Winter arrived. First shower caught me while biking.   

The Tibetan Rites books resulted to be absurdly dumb. I do not believe a word. At least they were very short and did not waste a lot of time.   

I continue reading the breathing book. I highlighted that CO2 is more important the O2. Thrilling for reading the reasons why.
